# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction

This repository serves as the foundation for understanding and documenting requirement analysis in software development. The focus is on a **Booking Management System**, simulating real-world scenarios to capture business and user needs precisely. It includes essential concepts, diagrams, and criteria to support robust and scalable software planning.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a structured process of identifying, analyzing, documenting, and validating the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system. It ensures a shared understanding between business stakeholders and development teams, reducing ambiguity and increasing project success.

**Importance in SDLC:**
- Bridges the gap between business needs and technical implementation.
- Reduces rework by identifying requirements early.
- Forms the basis for system design, testing, and validation.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

1. **Improves Clarity and Communication**
   - Ensures all stakeholders have a shared understanding of project goals.

2. **Reduces Project Risks**
   - Identifies potential issues early, minimizing costly changes later.

3. **Drives Efficient Development**
   - Provides developers with a clear roadmap, speeding up implementation.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

- **Requirement Gathering**
  - Collecting information from stakeholders through interviews, surveys, etc.

- **Requirement Elicitation**
  - Extracting accurate needs using tools like use cases, user stories, or observation.

- **Requirement Documentation**
  - Structuring requirements in clear, readable formats (e.g., SRS).

- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling**
  - Understanding relationships and workflows using models and diagrams.

- **Requirement Validation**
  - Ensuring documented requirements meet business goals and are testable.

## Types of Requirements

### Functional Requirements
Define the features and behaviors the system must support.

**Examples (Booking System):**
- Users can create an account and log in.
- Users can search for available bookings.
- Admin can approve or reject bookings.
- Users can cancel their bookings.

### Non-functional Requirements
Describe how the system performs under constraints.

**Examples (Booking System):**
- The system should load pages in under 2 seconds.
- Data must be encrypted at rest and in transit.
- The system should support up to 10,000 concurrent users.
- Interface should be responsive across all devices.

## Use Case Diagrams

Use Case Diagrams represent the interactions between system actors and functionalities. They help in visualizing requirements in a concise, structured way.

**Benefits:**
- Easy understanding of system behavior.
- Identifies all primary actors and their goals.
- Improves communication between stakeholders and developers.

##  Acceptance Criteria

Acceptance Criteria define specific conditions a feature must meet to be accepted by the stakeholder. They ensure the feature aligns with business needs.

**Importance:**
- Sets clear expectations.
- Prevents misunderstandings.
- Assists in testing and validation.

**Example: Checkout Feature in Booking System**

> **Feature**: Users can complete the booking checkout process.
>
> **Acceptance Criteria:**
> - The checkout page should display selected booking details.
> - Users must be able to confirm and pay via a secure payment gateway.
> - A confirmation message and email should be sent upon successful booking.
> - Booking status should change to "Confirmed" after payment.

## Tools Used

- **Markdown**: For structured documentation.
- **GitHub**: To manage version control and collaborate.
- **Draw.io**: To create the Use Case Diagram.

## Project Summary

This project demonstrates the fundamental role of **Requirement Analysis** in successful software delivery. By clearly identifying both functional and non-functional needs, illustrating use cases, and setting acceptance standards, we ensure alignment between technical teams and business goals.
